innerText will only give the text written inside the element 
textContent will give the text written inside the element including which are hide by applying some css properties
innerHTML will give element also which are written like h1,span etc


(1)`innerText`
Description: Returns the visible text content of an element and its descendants.
Behavior: Takes CSS into account, meaning it does not include text from hidden elements (elements with display: none or visibility: hidden). 

=Example:

let visibleText = document.getElementById('example').innerText;
console.log(visibleText);



(2) `textContent`
Description: Returns the text content of an element and all its descendants.
Behavior: Does not take CSS into account, meaning it includes all text, even from hidden elements.
= Example:

let allText = document.getElementById('example').textContent;
console.log(allText);


(3) `innerHTML`
Description: Returns the HTML content (including tags) of an element and its descendants.
Behavior: Provides a string containing the HTML structure, allowing access to the tags and their attributes.
= Example:

let htmlContent = document.getElementById('example').innerHTML;
console.log(htmlContent);


#######Examples to Illustrate Differences
Let's consider the following HTML structure:

html
Copy code
<div id="example">
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <span style="display:none">Hidden Text</span>
  <p>Visible Text</p>
</div>

#Using innerText:

let innerText = document.getElementById('example').innerText;
console.log(innerText); // Outputs: "Title\nVisible Text"
Only the visible text is returned.
"Hidden Text" is not included because it's hidden by CSS.



#Using textContent:

let textContent = document.getElementById('example').textContent;
console.log(textContent); // Outputs: "Title\nHidden Text\nVisible Text"
All text content, including the hidden "Hidden Text", is returned.



#Using innerHTML:


let innerHTML = document.getElementById('example').innerHTML;
console.log(innerHTML);
// Outputs: "<h1>Title</h1>\n<span style=\"display:none\">Hidden Text</span>\n<p>Visible Text</p>"
The entire HTML structure within the div is returned, including tags and their attributes.


########Conclusion
innerText: Best for getting or setting the visible text as rendered by the browser, considering CSS.
textContent: Best for getting or setting the full text content regardless of CSS.
innerHTML: Best for getting or setting the HTML structure, including tags and attributes.
These properties serve different purposes, and their use depends on what specific aspect of the content you need to manipulate or retrieve.
